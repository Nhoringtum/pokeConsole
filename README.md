# 🎮 PokeConsole [WIP]

Open Source Project about a console-based **C# RPG** featuring a real-time **ATB (Active Time Battle)** combat system that rewards strategic timing and resource management.

---

## 🧩 What's PokeConsole?

PokeConsole is a technical exploration of **modular architecture** and **state-driven systems** in a console environment.

### 🔧 Planned & Implemented Features
- 🕹️ **Real-time ATB combat loop** with dynamic turn resolution  
- 🧠 **Battle & player state machines** for clean, extensible logic  
- 🧪 **Unit tests** covering edge-case combat interactions  
- 💾 **Binary save system** ensuring reliable and efficient persistence  

> ✨ Built entirely in **C# / .NET 8**, focusing on **clarity, reusability, and system separation**.

## 🤔 Why this project?

I initially built a complex, extensible architecture for a school project — but it proved difficult for teammates to use effectively.  
PokeConsole is my attempt to **rethink and simplify that approach**, creating a **developer-friendly architecture** that balances flexibility and usability.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

🧱 Built with .NET 8 / C# — leveraging modern language features (records, async/await, pattern matching) for clean, concise code

🔧 Dependency Injection — enables modular, testable systems and decoupled architecture (easy to add AI, items, etc.)

🌍 Procedural Map Generation — randomizes encounters and layout for replayability

⚔️ Unit-Tested Combat Logic — battle flow validated with edge cases (status effects, simultaneous turns, critical timing)

💾 Save/Load System (Binary Serialization) — robust persistence with error handling and data integrity checks
